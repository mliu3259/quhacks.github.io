Hey,

Sooooooo the *.html pages are each of the pages on the site.  
Each one has to reload the nav bars at the top, so whenever you add/remove a page to the site, you have to change that for all of the html pages.  



***COLORS 'N STUFF***

The colors are controlled by custom.css.  
I've taken a couple hours to document what each of the color lines does so you can play around with it.
Spacing and such are controlled somewhere but idk where yet :)


***TO PREVIEW YOUR WORK***

While on index.html click on "Preview" at the top and then "live preview file"
Thanks to Mutaz for telling me this :)


***TO UPLOAD TO AMAZON WEB SERVICES***

Download the files you modified off of Cloud9
Go here...https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=us-west-2#&bucket=quhacks&prefix=
Login with the Amazon credentials below
In the correct subfolder, click "Actions" then "Upload"
A window will pop up prompting you to drag files in
Drag the appropriate files in and click "Start upload"
Once it's done, the files have been uploaded and the site should be updated in a couple seconds
Note: if you upload files of the same name as an existing file, it will overwrite it
